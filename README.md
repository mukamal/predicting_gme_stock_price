A few months ago, some people got together on a subreddit named “WallStreetBets“- a group already infamous for manipulating securities and using harsh language. The people came up with a plan to artificially raise the stock price of GameStop. Which lead to quite an impact and Gamestop's stock price skyrocketed from 20 USD to more than 400 USD. The stock price was mainly rising due to coordinated groups of retail investors on Reddit who planned and decided to invest in it.

For this project the dataset, Subreddit “WallStreetBets” Posts, available on Kaggle, was used that comprised a total of 31 thousand posts dating from 28th January,2021 till 21st April, 2021.
